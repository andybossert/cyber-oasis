## Thoughts

- I used green curry paste because I couldnâ€™t find yellow (doesn't seem as good)
- Go with to 3-4 tbs Curry paste if using green; never used yellow so not sure how it translates
- The above measurements are good for one person
- I added Cilli Powder and Curry Powered (would recommend)
- Break the rice noodles into small pieces
- Veggies need to be cut bite size
- Probably just use the entire 13.5oz Coconut milk can
- Use lots of Garlic and try to find NOT ground Ginger
- Could try couscous instead of rice noodles
- You could add lots of different cooked protiens at the end like chicken, shrimp, scallops
