## Ingredients

```
2 Salmon Fillets (2 lbs)
1 Orange Zested
1/4 Cup Orange Juice (about 1 orange juiced)
1/4 Cup Honey
1/4 Cup Soy Sauce (reduced sodium)
3 tbs Sriacha
1 tsp Sesame Oil
```

## Directions

1. Whisk together orange juice, orange zest, soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, and sriracha in a bowl.

2. Reserve about 1/4 cup of the sauce in a separate bowl for glazing later on.

3. Add remaining sauce to a shallow dish (or a plastic bag) and place the salmon in it to marinate for about 20 minutes, flipping the salmon over halfway through.

4. As the salmon is marinating, preheat oven to 400 degrees F. You'll want a rack to be situated in the middle of the oven, as well as one near the top.

5. Line a baking sheet with foil and spray it with cooking spray.

6. Once the salmon has finished marinating, place the salmon on the prepared sheet, skin side down, and bake on the middle rack for about 18 minutes.

7. After 18 minutes, remove the sheet from the oven and brush the reserved 1/4 cup of sauce over the salmon fillets (see note).

8. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F and place sheet on the upper oven rack.

9. Broil for about 2 minutes, or until the edges of the salmon begin to crisp and brown.

10. Serve!
