## Ingredients

```
2 tbs Olive Oil
6 oz. Fully Cooked Andouille Sausage
1 medium Onion
1 Red Pepper
2 clove Garlic
1 cup Long-Grain White Rice
1/2 cup Dry White Wine
2 tsp Creole Seasoning
1 3/4 cup Low-Sodium Chicken Broth
12 oz Peeled and Deveined Shrimp
12 oz Tomatoes
1/2 cup Fresh parsley
```

## Directions

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned, 1 to 2 minutes per side; transfer to a plate.

2. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onion and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Add the pepper and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are just tender, about 5 minutes more.

3. Stir in the rice, then the wine and seasoning and bring to a simmer. Add the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 12 minutes.

4. Fold the sausage into the rice mixture, then nestle the shrimp in the partially cooked rice and cook, covered, until the shrimp are opaque throughout and the rice is tender, 4 to 5 minutes more. Fold in the tomatoes and sprinkle with the parsley before serving.

## Thoughts

- Servers 4
- The Creole Seasoning used was really salty; I also didn't measure the first time I made it
- I used precooked rice and used 1 1/4 cup of Chicken Broth; probably would have made it less salty to use 1 3/4 cup
- Use less rice than you think
