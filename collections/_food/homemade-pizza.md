## Ingredients

### Crust

```
1 cup Hot Water
1 packet (2 1/4 tbs) Quick Rise Active Dry Yeast
1 tsp Sugar
2 1/2 cups Bread Flour
1 tsp Salt
2 tbs Olive Oil
```

### Pizza

```
Pizza Sauce
Motzorella Cheese
Oregano
Basil Leaves
Toppings
```

## Directions

1. Combine `Yeasts`, `Hot Water`, and `Sugar` in a medium Mixing bowl. Mixture
should bubble. Let proof (just let it sit there) for about 5 minutes.

2. Mix in `Flour` and `Salt`. A dough ball should be created an the bow should
be mostly clean. In other words no loose flour should be present in the bowl. 

3. Incoperate `Olive Oil` into the mixture. Work into a tight ball and cover.
Place in the fridge to rise for about 30 minutes.

4. Once dough has doubled in size spread onto desired cooking sheet/meathod. See
Thoughts for different cooking methods.

5. Top with `Sauce`, `Cheese`, `Oregano`, and `Basil`. Add additional toppings
as desired. Bake at 430 for about 10 mintes.

6. Enjoy

## Thoughts

- Main cooking method is to use a steel pizza pan with holes. Sprinkle crushed 
corn flakes on the bottom for added crunch and nonstick.
- Can use a ceramic stone for baking. Preheat the stone with the oven for best
results. Requires a pizza peal for transfering and finese.
