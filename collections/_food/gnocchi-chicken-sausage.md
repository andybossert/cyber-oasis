## Ingredients

```
1 package (16 oz) Potato Gnocchi
2 tbs Olive Oil
1 package (12 oz) fully cooked Italian Chicken Sausage
2 Shallots, finely chopped
2 Garlic Cloves, minced
1 cup White Wine
1 tbs Cornstarch
1/2 cup reduced-sodium Chicken Broth
3 cups Baby Spinach
1/2 cup Heavy Whipping Cream
1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Cheese
```

## Directions

1. Cook ``gnocchi`` according to package directions.

2. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Cook ``sausage`` and ``shallots`` until sausage is browned and shallots are tender. Add ``garlic``; cook 1 minute longer.

2. Stir in ``White Wine`` and bring to a boil. Cook until liquid is reduced by half, 3-4 minutes. 

3. In a small bowl, mix ``cornstarch`` and ``Chicken Broth`` until smooth; stir into sausage mixture. Return to a boil, stirring constantly; cook and stir until thickened, 1-2 minutes. 

4. Add ``spinach`` and ``cream``; cook and stir until spinach is wilted.

5. Drain gnocchi; add to pan and heat through. Sprinkle with cheese.

## Thoughts

- Turns into more of a soup than anything
- Needs salt and peper
- Kinda of missing something; maybe Chili Flakes or some spice
- Can use extra Chicken Broth instead of White Wine
