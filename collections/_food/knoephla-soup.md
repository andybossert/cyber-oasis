## Nutrient Facts

## Thoughts

- Add seasonings while cooking veggies at the start
    - could try garlic
    - could try nutmeg
    - could try thyme
    - 1 tbs or so Ground Pepper is good
    - 1 tbs or so Salt is recommended
    - Dill Weed is pretty good but don't use a lot, like 1/2 tsp
    - A little parsley is good, around 1/2 tsp
- Need something to make the Knoephla's fluffy (Baking Powder! 1ish tsp)
- The Knoephla expand so cut them small
- Make sure the Potatoes are bit size and roughly the same size so they cook even
