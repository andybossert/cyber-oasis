## Ingredients

### Chicken

```
2 Chicken Breasts, cut into 1-inch chunk
All-Purpose Flour
Large Eggs
Corn Flakes
```

### Sauce

```
1 1/2 cups chicken broth
1/4 cup hoisin sauce
1/4 cup rice vinegar
3 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoon brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons cornstarch
```

## Directions

1. Cut `Chicken Breats` into 1 to 2 inch chunks (bit sized).

2. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Coat a cooling rack with nonstick spray and 
place on a baking sheet; set aside.

3. Working in batches, dredge `chicken` in `flour`, dip into `eggs`, then dredge in 
`Corn Flakes`, pressing to coat.

4. Place onto prepared baking sheet and coat with nonstick spray. Place into 
oven and bake until golden brown and crisp, about 13-15 minutes.

5. In a large saucepan over medium high heat, combine `chicken broth`, `hoisin`, 
`rice vinegar`, `soy sauce`, `brown sugar`, and `cornstarch` until thickened, 
about 1-2 minutes. Stir in `chicken` and gently toss to combine.

6. Serve immediately.

## Nutrient Facts

## Thoughts

- The cooling rack is extremely important!
- When breading Chicken Get 3 larger bowls. Fill one with flour, one with
3-5 eggs, and one with Corn Flakes. Then you can just toss all the chicken
pieces in each. Otherwise you have to individually coat each piece, which
sucks
- Could try adding honey into the sauce
- Could try cracking peper over the chicken before baking
- Needs a garnish; probs sesame seeds and green onions
